# Anticoder03 DevOps Journey

This repo hosts my landing page as a DevOps beginner. It tells my story, shows the learning sprints I’m following, and points people to the resources I share.

## Highlights
- Personalized hero section with my study focus and call-to-action buttons.
- Cards that capture Linux/Git practice, CI/CD experiments, and Infra-as-Code notes.
- “Learning Sprints” pricing grid repurposed to showcase four phases of study.
- Contact panel with my `hey@anticoder03.dev` inbox and Discord handle `@anticoder03`.

## Stack
- Static HTML (`index.html`) styled with Tailwind via the `@tailwindcss/browser` CDN.
- Placeholder visuals from `dummyimage.com` until I capture screenshots from real labs.

## Getting Started
```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/Anticoder03/dev-ops-lab-01.git
cd dev-ops-lab-01.git

# open the page in your default browser
start index.html        # PowerShell / Windows
# open index.html       # macOS
# xdg-open index.html   # Linux
```

## Learning Roadmap
1. Swap dummy images for actual terminal/cloud captures.
2. Publish lab write-ups and study checklists inside `/notes`.
3. Automate deployment with GitHub Pages + CI workflow.
